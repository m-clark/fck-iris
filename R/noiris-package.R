#' @description  The goal of this package is primarily to provide data that is
#'   more relevant to the kind people would more typically come across in the wild,
#'   or is simply more interesting (at least to me).  Far too often examples use
#'   iris, mtcars, etc. for convenience, but these actually are inconvenient for
#'   demonstrating real data and modeling problems, or are too small to be very
#'   realistic examples of everyday data.  This package will provide larger and
#'   at some point messier data, that is better named, better documented, and
#'   would be useful across a variety of modeling contexts.
#' @details Right now it has:
