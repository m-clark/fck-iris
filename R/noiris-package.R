#' @description  This package is primarily to provide data that is more relevant to
#'  actual data people would typically come across in the wild, or is simply
#'  more interesting (at least to me).  Far too often examples use iris, mtcars,
#'  etc. for convenience, but actually are inconvenient for demonstrating real
#'  data and modeling problems, or are too small to even be realistic.  This
#'  package will provide larger and at some point messier data.
#'  @details Right now it has:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{gapminder}}{a 2019 pull from \url{http://www.gapminder.org/data/}}
#'   \item{\code{starwars}}{a variety of cleaned data sets produced using the \link[rwars]{rwars} package.}
