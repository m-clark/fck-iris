# noiris  <img src="data-raw/noiris.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 10%">

This package is primarily to provide data that is more similar to data people would typically come across in the wild, or is simply more interesting or accessible (in my opinion), and more useful for instruction and workshops.  Far too often examples use `iris`, `mtcars`, etc. for convenience, but these actually are inconvenient for demonstrating real data and modeling problems, or are too small to even be realistic.  

This package will provide larger and at some point messier data.  The bias is towards data that could be understood regardless of discipline/background. In addition, it should have minimally several hundred observations, and often much larger, but not so large that analysis or data processing demonstration would take an inordinate amount of time.  However, it should have relatively few columns (unless for demonstration of a 'large p' type of problem/analysis, e.g. penalized regression.).


Some of the data comes from elsewhere, but has been cleaned up to make it easier to use and understand.

Right now it has:

- `gapminder`: a 2019 pull from [gapminder.org/data](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). A nice longitudinal/time-series data set.
- `star_wars`: several data sets based on the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/). Just for fun. It demonstrates usage of list columns and otherwise could be good for demonstrating joins.
- `instructor_evaluations`: a nice-sized data set for mixed/multilevel modeling taken from the `lme4` package.
- `fish`: an accessible data set useful for demonstrating count and zero-inflated/hurdle models.
- `pisa`: OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment with international scores for math, science, and reading.  Potentially  good for demonstrating nonlinear relationships, imputing missing data, longitudinal analyses. 

incoming: world happiness report, wine ratings?
